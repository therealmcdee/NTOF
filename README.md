# NTOF
Neutron Time of Flight Experiment (LANL 2021)

Took multiple data sets of NTOF spectrometer to characterize motion of shutter

beamvac_28_mil_* == data sets taken from NTOF spectrometer controlling software (I believe we had the rpm/speed at 2.8 mil)

mult_analyze_velocity.py == simple python script to analyze these data sets and give an idea of timing (input should be the directory files are in)
